# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This was one of my first front-end coding challenges on Frontend Mentor. I enjoyed styling it using flexbox and using different containers to center the images on the page. I made it responsive, and this took me a while as I got used to using the browser developer tools.

The final project code is in the main branch.

## The challenge

The challenge was to build my own social links profile and make the page responsive and interactive.

Users are able to:

- See, hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Successfully navigate to the websites when clicking on each button

## Building the project

1. I initialised the project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlexStraton/Social-Links-page/tree/main).
2. I looked through the designs to start planning out the project. This step was crucial as it made me think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
3. Before adding any styles, I created well-structured content using HTML.
4. I then added the base styles for the project, including general content styles, and on-hover effects.
5. I created and linked a js file in order to make the links interactive.
6. I made the page responsive for different mobile devices and screen sizes.

## Deploying your project

I hosted the project on:
